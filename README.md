# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Functionality and secure code can come down to one term, testing. Ample and frequent testing at the earliest stages of the software development lifecycle. Depending on the nature of the software, certain testing techniques should be applied. If the application deals with financial information, heavy cyber security testing would be recommended. If fast performance and a smooth user interface is the goal, then different testing techniques should be applied. Overall, testing can improve the functionality of any software or application. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are what makes each software different. It is extremely important to incorporate the users needs into the application because in the end, that is the entire point. Granted the user may not know the best approach on how to accomplish their needs, but it is a developer’s goal to achieve these needs. Strong communication skills are required to fully understand what the client wishes the product to do, and strong programming skills are required to turn those ideas into working and secure software. 

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software in an agile approach. First by fully understanding what the client wishes the software to do, suggest any improvements, and design the layout with the user in mind. I would then discuss these ideas with my team and design the software. Once implementation begins, so will testing and security measures. If a problem occurs, or better approaches come to light, I will inform the client and discuss any changes to be made. Strong testing techniques, such as static and dynamic testing, will allow me to understand how the inner workings of the software will perform and if they are up to the clients’ standards.
